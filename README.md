# Filecoin Grants


Welcome to the Filecoin Grant Platform! The Filecoin Grant Platform connects grant makers with builders and researchers in the Filecoin community. Whether you represent a foundation that wants to move the space forward, a company looking to accelerate development on the features your application needs, or a dev team itching to hack on Filecoin tools, you've come to the right place. Take a look at the supported grant types and available opportunities below.

## Grant Types

---

### Open Grant
Do you have an idea for pushing the Filecoin ecosystem forward? Grants up to $50,000+ are available to support novel ideas that advance the Filecoin ecosystem, bring significant new usage, or directly advance the Filecoin mission statement.


[**LEARN MORE ABOUT OPEN GRANTS**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Program%20Details/Open%20Grants%20README.md) **AND** [**APPLY FOR AN OPEN GRANT**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=open-grant-application.md&title=)

### Requests for Proposals (RFPs)
RFPs are grants for specific development work. As the name suggests, we are requesting proposals from teams that want to complete the work specified in each RFP. In these grants, we generally have clearly scoped deliverables, milestones, and funding limits. Some RFPs will ask you to propose your own milestones and funding needs. While there is some flexibility in RFP deliverables, we expect teams will deliver what is in scope in the RFP. Any deviations from the specified scope must be approved between your team and ours before we can approve funding. RFPs may be funded by Protocol Labs, other community members, or a consortium of interested parties.

OPEN RFPs: Keep an eye out for future RFPs!

CLOSED RFPs:

* [Zcash x Filecoin](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Archive/rfps/zcash-and-filecoin.md)
* [FVM Tooling & Infrastructure](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Archive/rfps/fvm-open-tools-infra.md)
* [Green Grants](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Archive/rfps/green-grants.md)

### Next Step Microgrants

Grants of $5,000 in FIL are available to support those taking the _next step_ after creating an initial prototype with Filecoin, IPFS, or related technologies.

Since January 27, 2023, microgrants are exclusively awarded for projects within rotating [Microgrant focus areas](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/Archive/microgrants/microgrants.md#focus-areas). Applications for the most recent focus area, [Filecoin Virtual Machine](https://fvm.filecoin.io/), are currently being processed. 

If you have (1) a working prototype that matches the current focus area and (2) concrete _next steps_ for your project, consider applying for a microgrant!

This program is intended for early stage projects. If your project has already received more than $30,000 USD from any source, please apply for an open grant (details below) rather than a microgrant.
