# Filecoin Grants


Welcome to the Filecoin Grant Platform! The Filecoin Grant Platform connects grant makers with builders and researchers in the Filecoin community. Whether you represent a foundation that wants to move the space forward, a company looking to accelerate development on the features your application needs, or a dev team itching to hack on Filecoin tools, you've come to the right place. Take a look at the supported grant types and available opportunities below.

## Grant Types

---

### Next Step Microgrants
Starting <INSERT DATE HERE>, our microgrants program will be available specifically for pre-identified work within our ecosystem - starting with the upcoming FVM launch! If you are 1) building with FVM in a current project, 2) looking for ways to fund the next steps of your work, and 3) have a working prototype to showcase to our team, consider applying for a microgrant! Grants are valued at $5,000 USD and are paid in FIL.

These grants are intended for independent developers, small studios, non-profits, activists, and researchers. Applicants may be working independently or continuing with work started at a course or hackathon. 

The microgrants are intended for early stage projects. If your project has already received more than $30,000 USD from any source, please apply for an open grant (details below) rather than a microgrant.

### Open Grant
Do you have an idea for pushing the Filecoin ecosystem forward? Grants of over $5000 are available to support novel ideas that advance the Filecoin ecosystem, bring significant new usage, or directly advance the Filecoin mission statement.

### Requests for Proposals (RFPs)
RFPs are grants for specific development work. As the name suggests, we are requesting proposals from teams that want to complete the work specified in each RFP. In these grants, we generally have clearly scoped deliverables, milestones, and funding limits. Some RFPs will ask you to propose your own milestones and funding needs. While there is some flexibility in RFP deliverables, we expect teams will deliver what is in scope in the RFP. Any deviations from the specified scope must be approved between your team and ours before we can approve funding. RFPs may be funded by Protocol Labs, other community members, or a consortium of interested parties.

OPEN RFPs:


* [**FVM Project Ideas**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/rfps/fvm-rfp-ideas.md) RFP
* [**FVM Tooling & Infrastructure**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/rfps/fvm-open-tools-infra.md) RFP
* [**Green Grants**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/blob/master/rfps/green-grants.md) RFP - **The RFP is currently closed.**
