# Project Description
Today, we are quickly racing toward the 6th mass global extinction with rapid decline in biodiversity amid the throes of climate change, while tens of millions are subject to forced labor as slaves who suffer in the shadows of our lives -- in the clothing we wear, the food we eat and the technology we use. Meanwhile, our democracies and social fabrics are challenged by nefarious forces in political power grabs amid an unprecedented global pandemic and economic collapse. Never before have we needed a source of unhackable truth to insure the voice of the people and planet.

BFLO technology helps track, verify and manage sustainability claims for proof of reputation around business investment leveraging the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

"BFLO AND THE SDGs" is our project to leverage BFLO technology, Filecoin and IPFS storage. Our grand vision is to store and map the world's SDG claims to public attestations and verification that these claims meet one or more the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Filecoin as an incentivization mechanism to the community, shall facilitate the processing and indexing for users to leverage our tools for reporting and verification of their SDG claims.

## Value

The United Nations adopted the SDGs as the framework to solve our greatest challenges and today over 14,000 governments, finance and business entities agree to meet the goals as a result of these clamering concerns. With growing pressure in the global community, over 1/3 the world's wealth under management is being divested from dirty investments in favor of those that support solving climate change and have positive Environment Social Governanve (ESG) scores. 

While Nature will survive and reset, the risks of us not solving climate change points towards the suffering of future generations and countless species we rely on in our delicate web of life.  At present, humanity's added pressure of crumbling global democracies require we have anchors of truth amid a landscape of ever shifting information and "fake news", where pundits provide 35-65% of the false information, and our leaders are removing vast libraries of environmental information. 

By creating a global repository for public attestations, both positive and negative, we can begin to see the truth behind the flow of respources, tanglible and intangible. We need entitites to be held accountable for their committments versus using these as a lever for branding. 

Since Filecoin stands for new paradigms of truth through information, value to Filecoin is to meet the organization's mission, and to provide meaningful collective intelligence that can help guide us toward the world we want to be, while we rapidly scale solutions by providing the landscape map and transparency. 

## Deliverables

This project proposal includes connecting IPFS and Filecoin's SDK to the BFLO technology stack. In sum, the roadmap will consider designing the architecture and implementing the information on IPFS so we have a standard way of representing information provided in Web3 for sustainable attestations over the decentralized web.

1. Connect IPFS to BFLO's technology stack for public attestations
We will migrate the existing BFLO Commons onto IPFS to include public attestation and SDG reporting currently in the BFLO system and enable users to push their public claims to the BFLO Commons onn IPFS. 

2. Connect Filecoin SDK to BFLO's technology stack 
Implement Filecoin via SDK as a mechanism to increase incentivization for users of BFLO who upload their public claims to the BFLO data commons to pin these claims. 

3. BFLO Commons Explorer
Develop a browser based explorer of BFLO Commons using REACT that connects the front end to the BFLO Data Commons via REST API

## Roadmap, Timeline, Budget
The roadmap timeline runs over a 3 month period from the date of the grant receipt. Milestones will be developed in parallel as follows:

## Breakdown of Budget

Professional Fees: 85%.
Project Management: 10%
Administration & Operations, Accounting: 5%.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Phase 2 Plans are:

• Build towards v2.0 of the BFLO Commons
• Added functionality we envision including are indexing tools to access and interact with blockchain attestations.
• Deepen engagement with W3C to promote the adoption of BFLO technology by verifiers and certifiers, and the technology by relevant ecosystem players.

We anticipate with use there will be nuances. We will seek to refine as time and resources allow.
