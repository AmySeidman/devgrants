# Project Description
Today, 30-40 million slaves suffer in the shadows of our lives -- in the clothing we wear, the food we eat and the technology we use. Similarly we are quickly racing toward the 6th mass global extinction with rapid decline in biodiversity amid the throes of climate change, while our democracies and social fabrics are challenged by nefarious forces in political power grabs amid an unprecedented global pandemic and economic collapse. Never before have we needed a source of unhackable truth to insure the voice of the people and planet.

BFLO technology helps track, verify and manage sustainability claims for proof of reputation around business investment leveraging the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

"BFLO, FREEFLO, AND THE SDGs" is our project to leverage BFLO technology and IPFS storage to store and map the world's SDG claims and public attestations to meeting the 17 SDGs. We wish leverage Filecoin as an incentivization mechanism to the community and enable the processing and indexing for users to leverage our tools for reporting and verification of their SDG claims.

## Value

The United Nations adopted the SDGs as the framework to solve our greatest challenges and today over 14,000 governments, finance and business entities are agreeing to meet the goals as a result of these clamering concerns and the growing pressure of 1/3 the world's wealth being divested from dirty investments in favor of those which support solving climate change and have positive Environment Social Governanve (ESG) scores. 

While Nature will survive and reset, the risks of us not solving climate change points towards the suffering of future generations and countless species we rely on in our delicate web of life.  At present, humanity's added pressure of crumbling global democracies require we have anchors of truth amid a landscape of ever shifting information and "fake news", where pundits provide 35-65% of the false information, and our leaders are removing vast libraries of environmental information. 

By creating a global repository for public attestations, both positive and negative, we can begin to see the truth behind the flow of respources, tanglible and intangible. We need entitites to be held accountable for their committments versus using these as a lever for branding. 

Since Filecoin stands for new paradigms of truth through information, value to Filecoin is to meet the organization's mission, and to provide meaningful collective intelligence that can help guide us toward the world we want to be in and rapidly scale solutions by providing the landscape map and transparency. 

## Deliverables


This project shall include three phases:

1. Create the BFLO Commons on IPFS to include public attestation and SDG reporting currently in BFLO and enable users to push their public claims to BFLO Commons. Include FREEFLO the safeguard tool in BFLO for grievances by NGOs and citizens of the world across a variety of topics from environment and climate change to Black Lives Matter and voter suppression.

2. Provide a map and data visualization to global SDG public claims and grievances in the BFLO Data Commons. 

3. Implement Filecoin as a mechanism to increase incentivization for users of BFLO who upload their public claims to the BFLO data commons to store these claims. 


## Development Roadmap

Week 1-3: 
Transition BFLO commons on IPFS from POC to MVP
Tie-in API for BFLO reporting and mobile app for grievances
Integrate with platform to input publicly opted in SDG claims and greivances to the BFLO commons on IPFS
Include geotags and times stamps to all claims
Implement the API of the UN Open Data Hub of global SDG claims into IPFS
$32.5K

Week 5:
Index using The Graph or similar solution
Geomap and data visualize for contextual relationships 
$15.5K

Week 6:
Create an SDK that empowers others to input SDG claims to the BFLO commons on IPFS
Integrate BFLO API for claims
Integrate Filecoin storage costs
$13K

Other costs: $14K 
Accessible and maintained for 6 months, software licenses, cloud implementation, some gas and filecoin costs for grievances 

Project duration 6 weeks. 

## Total Budget Requested

Budget breakdown: $75,000

Design, UX UI - 9,500
Software engineers - 35,000
Project Lead - 12,500 
Documentation - 1,500
QA & Bug repair - 2,500
Other - 14,000

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

After Filecoin mainnet launches, incorporate new code, storage costs, and storage terms
Our goal is for users of BFLO to input ongoing claims and over the next 6 months we will add to the commons whatever claims are made that are opted into the public BFLO Data Commons

We anticipate with use there will be nuances and we will seek to refine as time and resources allow.
