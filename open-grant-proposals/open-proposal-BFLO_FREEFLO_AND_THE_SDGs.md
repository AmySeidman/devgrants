# Project Description
Today, 30-40 million slaves suffer in the shadows of our lives -- in the clothing we wear, the food we eat and the technology we use. Similarly we are quickly racing toward the 6th mass global extinction with rapid decline in biodiversity amid the throes of climate change, while our democracies and social fabrics are challenged by nefarious forces in political power grabs amid an unprecedented global pandemic and economic collapse. Never before have we needed a source of unhackable truth to insure the voice of the people and planet.

BFLO technology helps track, verify and manage sustainability claims for proof of reputation around business investment leveraging the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

"BFLO, FREEFLO, AND THE SDGs" is our project to leverage BFLO technology and IPFS storage to store and map the world's SDG claims and public attestations to meeting the 17 SDGs. We wish leverage Filecoin as an incentivization mechanism to the community and enable the processing and indexing for clients of BFLO seeking to leverage our tools for reporting and verification of their claims.

## Value

The United Nations adopted the SDGs as the framework to solve our greatest challenges and today over 14,000 governments, finance and business entities are agreeing to meet as a result of these clamering concerns, and the growing pressure of over $40T under wealth management being divested in favor of climate change and companies with positive Environment Social Governanve (ESG) scores. 

The risks of us not solving climate change are thje suffering of our future generations. At present, humanity's added pressure of crumbling global democracies require we have anchors of truth amid a landscape of ever shifting information and "fake news", where pundits provide 35-65% of the false information, and our leaders removed vast libraries of environmental information. 

By creating a global repository for public attestations, both positive and negative, we can begin to see the truth behind this. We need entitites to be held accountable for their committments versus using these as a lever for branding. Since Filecoin stands for new paradigms of truth through information, value to Filecoin is to meet the organization's mission, and to provide meaningful collective intelligence that can help guide us toward the world we want to be in and rapidly scale solutions by providing the landscape map and transparency. 

## Deliverables


This project shall include three phases:

1. Create the BFLO Commons on IPFS to include public attestation and SDG reporting currently in BFLO and enable users to push their public claims to BFLO Commons. Include FREEFLO the safeguard tool in BFLO for grievances by NGOs and citizens of the world across a variety of topics from environment and climate change to Black Lives Matter and voter suppression.

2. Provide a map and data visualization to global the SDG public claims and grievances in the BFLO Data Commons. 

3. Implement Filecoin for users of BFLO who upload their public claims to the BFLO data commons as a mechanism to increase incentivization  around storing these claims. 


## Development Roadmap

Week 1-3: 
Create BFLO commons on IPFS
System to input publicly optedin SDG claims and greivances to the BFLO commons on IPFS, include geotags and times stamps to all claims
$30K

Implement the API of the UN Open Data Hub of global SDG claims into IPFS
$5K

Week 4-5:
Indexing using The Graph or similar solution
Geomap and other visualizations using technologies such as D3.js and google maps
$30K

Week 6:
Create an SDK that includes API for others to input SDG claims to the BFLO commons on IPFS with BFLO and Filecoin
$15K

Other costs: $10K 
software licenses, cloud implementation, gas and filecoin costs for users who can not afford to pay for gas and fees

Project duration 6 weeks, accessible maintained for 6 months

## Total Budget Requested

Budget breakdown: $90,000

Design, UX UI - $14,500
Software engineers - 40,000
Project Management - $18,000 
Documentation - 5,000
QA - 2,500
Other - 10,000

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Our goal is for users of BFLO to input ongoing claims and over the next 6 months we will add to the commons whatever claims are made that are opted into the public BFLO Data Commons

We anticipate with use there will be nuances and we will seek to refine as time and resources allow.
