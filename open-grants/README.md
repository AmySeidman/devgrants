# Open Grants

## About
Do you have an idea for pushing the Filecoin ecosystem forward? Open grants are intended to support novel ideas that advance the Filecoin ecosystem, bring significant new usage, or directly advance the Filecoin mission statement. 

We welcome proposals in the following categories:

- **Developer and Data Tooling**: For projects that close important experience gaps for developers or large dataset users. This might include improvements to command line or visual UX, API improvements, data preparation and ingest tools, developer tools and infrastructure, and more. 

- **Applications**: For projects that apply Filecoin, IPFS, or related technologies in novel ways to solve meaningful, real-world problems. Proposals in this category should have a strong understanding of, and working relationship with, a specific target audience. 
- **Integrations**: For projects that add integration or support for Filecoin, IPFS, or related technologies into popular, or fast-growing, existing tools and developer communities in Web2 or Web3. 

- **Research & protocols**: For projects aimed at improving the foundations of Filecoin, IPFS, and related technologies.

- **Other**: From time to time, we may fund projects that donâ€™t fit in the categories above, such as in the areas of community growth, but please contact us via grants@filecoin.org to discuss before submitting an application. 

Open Grants are generally awarded in the amounts of $10,000+ , across several milestones. If this is your first, we strongly recommend scoping your project to under $50,000.

## ðŸ“‹ How to apply
                                    
To submit an Open Grant proposal, [create a new issue](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=open-grant-application.md&title=) using the Open Grants Proposal template.
                                                                                                                        
Open Grant proposals are reviewed monthly. We aim to notify applicants of a decision by the end of the following month. (For example, if you apply anytime between March 1-31, youâ€™ll be notified by April 30th.)                                                        

## âŒ› After you apply

After you submit your proposal, you can expect the following to occur:
- We will review your application. During review, we will add comments, questions, change requests, etcetera on your team's submission. Please look for comments on your Github issue.
- After a few round trips of discussion, our team will make a decision on which proposals to recommend funding and which not to.
- During the discussion and review phase, we will contact your team for financial and legal follow-ups, such as to confirm milestones and funding, your team's legal structure, etc.
- If your proposal is accepted, we will ask you to review and sign our Open Source Software Grant Agreement, which will include a copy of the work plan and funding milestones.
- Grants should not be treated as final, or the funding as fully approved, until after the Grant Agreement is signed by both sides. 

Please reach out to #grants-help on Filecoin Slack or email grants@filecoin.org with any questions.
